"Control channel lasts throughout the ftp session and is used to transfer all commands (ls, get, and put) from client to server and all status/error
messages from server to client. The initial channel on which the client connects to serverwill be the
control channel. Data channel is used for data transfer. It is established and torn down for every file
transfer â€“ when the client wants to transfer data (ls, get, or put), it generates an ephemeral port to use
for connection and then wait for the server to connect to the client on that port."
